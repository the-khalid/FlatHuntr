# flathuntr
It lets you access all the to-let flats near you!
You can add/remove your location from to-let map and also can search for to-let flats near you added by others.


This Website is developed using html, inline css for front-end, some pinch of javascript and Flask (a python web application framework based on WSGI toolkit and jinja template engine) for back-end.


For Map, I used Google Maps API.


Deployed to render, here's the link - [FlatHuntr](https://flathuntr.onrender.com/)
